We are targeting students of our Neuroscience Master programs (credited course) but also welcome students from any other related subjects. We are currently still in the organization process, but we expect the Marburg Hub to start at the beginning of June, providing all modules made available by the Brainhack School team and instructors. Contrary to last year, we are hoping to be able to organize the school as an in-person event and provide support for project work (location will be at Philipps-University Marburg).
